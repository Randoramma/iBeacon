# iBeacon
iOS app using Swift 2.0 turning your phone into both an iBeacon or a iBeacon ranging device.  The application is designed to run on two separate Bluetooth LE-capable iOS devices, with each device running in the different roles. The central role device will scan and connect to the peripheral device, which will be advertising a simple service. Once connected, the peripheral device will transfer data to the central device, which will then present that data to the user.
